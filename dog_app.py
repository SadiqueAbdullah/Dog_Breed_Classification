# ## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App 
# 
# 
# This notebook walks you through one of the most popular Udacity projects across machine learning and artificial intellegence nanodegree programs.  The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed.  
# 
# If you are looking for a more guided capstone project related to deep learning and convolutional neural networks, this might be just it.  Notice that even if you follow the notebook to creating your classifier, you must still create a blog post or deploy an application to fulfill the requirements of the capstone project.
# 
# Also notice, you may be able to use only parts of this notebook (for example certain coding portions or the data) without completing all parts and still meet all requirements of the capstone project.
#

# 
# 
# ### Why We're Here 
# 
# In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). 
# 
# ![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)
# 
# In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

# ## Step 0: Import Datasets
# 
# ### Import Dog Dataset
# 
# In the code cell below, we import a dataset of dog images.  We populate a few variables through the use of the `load_files` function from the scikit-learn library:
# - `train_files`, `valid_files`, `test_files` - numpy arrays containing file paths to images
# - `train_targets`, `valid_targets`, `test_targets` - numpy arrays containing onehot-encoded classification labels 
# - `dog_names` - list of string-valued dog breed names for translating labels

# In[52]:


from sklearn.datasets import load_files       
from keras.utils import np_utils
import numpy as np
from glob import glob

# define function to load train, test, and validation datasets
def load_dataset(path):
    data = load_files(path)
    dog_files = np.array(data['filenames']) 
    dog_targets = np_utils.to_categorical(np.array(data['target']), 133)
    return dog_files, dog_targets

# load train, test, and validation datasets
train_files, train_targets = load_dataset('../../../data/dog_images/train')
valid_files, valid_targets = load_dataset('../../../data/dog_images/valid')
test_files, test_targets = load_dataset('../../../data/dog_images/test')

# load list of dog names
dog_names = [item[20:-1] for item in sorted(glob("../../../data/dog_images/train/*/"))]

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total dog categories.' % len(dog_names))
print('There are %s total dog images.\n' % len(np.hstack([train_files, valid_files, test_files])))
print('There are %d training dog images.' % len(train_files))
print('There are %d validation dog images.' % len(valid_files))
print('There are %d test dog images.'% len(test_files))


# ### Import Human Dataset
# 
# In the code cell below, we import a dataset of human images, where the file paths are stored in the numpy array `human_files`.

# In[53]:


import random
random.seed(8675309)

# load filenames in shuffled human dataset
human_files = np.array(glob("../../../data/lfw/*/*"))
random.shuffle(human_files)

# print statistics about the dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))


# ---
# <a id='step1'></a>
# ## Step 1: Detect Humans
# 
# We use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.
# 
# In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.

# In[54]:


import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# extract pre-trained face detector
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')

# load color (BGR) image
img = cv2.imread(human_files[18])
# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()


# Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  
# 
# In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.
# 
# ### Write a Human Face Detector
# 
# We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.

# In[55]:


# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    return len(faces) > 0


# ### Assess the Human Face Detector
# 
# __Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face? 
# 
# Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# 
# 1) 100% of the first 100 images in human_files have  detected human face.
# 
# 2) 11% of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have  detected dog face.

# In[56]:


from tqdm import tqdm
human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = train_files[:100]
# Do NOT modify the code above this line.

## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm 
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.

print(str(np.sum([face_detector(file) for file in human_files_short])) + '% of human images with a detected face')
print(str(np.sum([face_detector(file) for file in dog_files_short])) + '% of dog images with a detected face')


# __Question 2:__ This algorithmic choice necessitates that we communicate to the user that we accept human images only when they provide a clear view of a face (otherwise, we risk having unneccessarily frustrated users!). In your opinion, is this a reasonable expectation to pose on the user? If not, can you think of a way to detect humans in images that does not necessitate an image with a clearly presented face?
# 
# __Answer:__
# 
# We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :).  Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on each of the datasets.

## (Optional) TODO: Report the performance of another  
## face detection algorithm on the LFW dataset

# <a id='step2'></a>
# ## Step 2: Detect Dogs
# 
# In this section, we use a pre-trained [ResNet-50](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006) model to detect dogs in images.  Our first line of code downloads the ResNet-50 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  Given an image, this pre-trained ResNet-50 model returns a prediction (derived from the available categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.

# In[58]:


from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50

# define ResNet50 model
ResNet50_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')


# ### Pre-process the Data
# 
# When using TensorFlow as backend, Keras CNNs require a 4D array (which we'll also refer to as a 4D tensor) as input, with shape
# 
# $$
# (\text{nb_samples}, \text{rows}, \text{columns}, \text{channels}),
# $$
# 
# where `nb_samples` corresponds to the total number of images (or samples), and `rows`, `columns`, and `channels` correspond to the number of rows, columns, and channels for each image, respectively.  
# 
# The `path_to_tensor` function below takes a string-valued file path to a color image as input and returns a 4D tensor suitable for supplying to a Keras CNN.  The function first loads the image and resizes it to a square image that is $224 \times 224$ pixels.  Next, the image is converted to an array, which is then resized to a 4D tensor.  In this case, since we are working with color images, each image has three channels.  Likewise, since we are processing a single image (or sample), the returned tensor will always have shape
# 
# $$
# (1, 224, 224, 3).
# $$
# 
# The `paths_to_tensor` function takes a numpy array of string-valued image paths as input and returns a 4D tensor with shape 
# 
# $$
# (\text{nb_samples}, 224, 224, 3).
# $$
# 
# Here, `nb_samples` is the number of samples, or number of images, in the supplied array of image paths.  It is best to think of `nb_samples` as the number of 3D tensors (where each 3D tensor corresponds to a different image) in your dataset!

# In[59]:


from keras.preprocessing import image                  
from tqdm import tqdm

def path_to_tensor(img_path):
    # loads RGB image as PIL.Image.Image type
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    # convert PIL.Image.Image type to 3D tensor with shape (224, 224, 3)
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    # convert 3D tensor to 4D tensor with shape (1, 224, 224, 3) and return 4D tensor
    return np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

def paths_to_tensor(img_paths):
    list_of_tensors = [path_to_tensor(img_path) for img_path in tqdm(img_paths)]
    return np.vstack(list_of_tensors)


# ### Making Predictions with ResNet-50
# 
# Getting the 4D tensor ready for ResNet-50, and for any other pre-trained model in Keras, requires some additional processing.  First, the RGB image is converted to BGR by reordering the channels.  All pre-trained models have the additional normalization step that the mean pixel (expressed in RGB as $[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]$ and calculated from all pixels in all images in ImageNet) must be subtracted from every pixel in each image.  This is implemented in the imported function `preprocess_input`.  If you're curious, you can check the code for `preprocess_input` [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py).
# 
# Now that we have a way to format our image for supplying to ResNet-50, we are now ready to use the model to extract the predictions.  This is accomplished with the `predict` method, which returns an array whose $i$-th entry is the model's predicted probability that the image belongs to the $i$-th ImageNet category.  This is implemented in the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function below.
# 
# By taking the argmax of the predicted probability vector, we obtain an integer corresponding to the model's predicted object class, which we can identify with an object category through the use of this [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). 

# In[60]:


from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

def ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path):
    # returns prediction vector for image located at img_path
    img = preprocess_input(path_to_tensor(img_path))
    return np.argmax(ResNet50_model.predict(img))


# ### Write a Dog Detector
# 
# While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, we need only check if the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function above returns a value between 151 and 268 (inclusive).
# 
# We use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).

# In[61]:


### returns "True" if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path
def dog_detector(img_path):
    prediction = ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path)
    return ((prediction <= 268) & (prediction >= 151)) 


# ### Assess the Dog Detector
# 
# __Question 3:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of your `dog_detector` function.  
# - What percentage of the images in `human_files_short` have a detected dog?  
# - What percentage of the images in `dog_files_short` have a detected dog?
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# 
# 1) 0% of detected dogs in human_files_short file
# 
# 2) 100% of detected dogs in dog_files_short file

# In[62]:


### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function
### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
print(str(np.sum([dog_detector(file) for file in human_files_short])) + '% of detected dogs in human_files_short file')
print(str(np.sum([dog_detector(file) for file in dog_files_short])) + '% of detected dogs in dog_files_short file')

# <a id='step3'></a>
# ## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
# 
# Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 1%.  In Step 5 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.
# 
# Be careful with adding too many trainable layers!  More parameters means longer training, which means you are more likely to need a GPU to accelerate the training process.  Thankfully, Keras provides a handy estimate of the time that each epoch is likely to take; you can extrapolate this estimate to figure out how long it will take for your algorithm to train. 
# 
# We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have great difficulty in distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  
# 
# Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
# - | - 
# <img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100"> | <img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200">
# 
# It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  
# 
# Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel
# - | -
# <img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200"> | <img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200">
# 
# 
# Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  
# 
# Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
# - | -
# <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220">
# 
# We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  
# 
# Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun! 
# 
# ### Pre-process the Data
# 
# We rescale the images by dividing every pixel in every image by 255.

# In[63]:


from PIL import ImageFile                            
ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True                 

# pre-process the data for Keras
train_tensors = paths_to_tensor(train_files).astype('float32')/255
valid_tensors = paths_to_tensor(valid_files).astype('float32')/255
test_tensors = paths_to_tensor(test_files).astype('float32')/255


# In[64]:


# Checking the shpe of train_tensors

# ###  Model Architecture
# 
# Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  At the end of your code cell block, summarize the layers of your model by executing the line:
#     
#         model.summary()
# 
# We have imported some Python modules to get you started, but feel free to import as many modules as you need.  If you end up getting stuck, here's a hint that specifies a model that trains relatively fast on CPU and attains >1% test accuracy in 5 epochs:
# 
# ![Sample CNN](images/sample_cnn.png)
#            
# __Question 4:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  If you chose to use the hinted architecture above, describe why you think that CNN architecture should work well for the image classification task.
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# 
# For the below executed CNN , the base architecture contains 3 convolutional and 3 max pooling layers paired together in series and arrange in alternate sequence. The Convolutional layer serves the purpose of deriving high level features through filters. Max pooling layer reduces the dimensionality and hence the execution time. Relu activation function was used in all the Convolutional layers.
# 
# Total 5 convolutional layers were used with filters ranging from 16 to 256 in creasing order with multipe of 2 in consecutive layers.
# 
# 1 Golbal average pooling layer was used before final layer to reduce the dimensionality of the CNN.
# 
# 5 Max pooling layers were used with default setting and with a pool size of 2,2.
# 
# For the last and fully connected layer the nodes were set to 133 along with a softmax activation function to obtain probabilities of the prediction of Dog breed.
# 
# ##### Did some experiments below to test and improve Test accuracy. 
# 
# CL : Count of Convolutional layer
# 
# MP : count of Max Pooling layer
# 
# FL : Count of Flatten layer
# 
# DOR : Dropout rate
# 
# 
# 1) CL=3 MP=3 DOR=NA EPOCH=20 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 6.4593%
# 
# 2) CL=3 MP=3 DOR=0.2 EPOCH=20 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 11.3636%
# 
# 3) CL=4 MP=4 DOR=NA EPOCH=20 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 14.5933%
# 
# 4) CL=4 MP=4 DOR=0.3 EPOCH=25 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 11.0048%

# 5) CL=4 MP=4 1FL 1 Relu activation DOR=0.3 EPOCH=20 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 11.0048%
# 
# 6) CL=5 MP=5 DOR=0.4 EPOCH=30 Batchsize=20-----Test accuracy: 29.6651%
# 
# A Deeper network of above combination of Convolutional and Max pool layers seems to contributing to Test accuracy along with moderate Dropout rate (0.4 to 0.5) and epoch=30 seems to also contributing factor for Test Accuracy which needs additional tuning.

# <a id='step5'></a>
# ## Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
# 
# You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.  Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.
# 
# In Step 4, we used transfer learning to create a CNN using VGG-16 bottleneck features.  In this section, you must use the bottleneck features from a different pre-trained model.  To make things easier for you, we have pre-computed the features for all of the networks that are currently available in Keras:
# - [VGG-19](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG19Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [ResNet-50](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [Inception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogInceptionV3Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [Xception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogXceptionData.npz) bottleneck features
# 
# The files are encoded as such:
# 
#     Dog{network}Data.npz
#     
# where `{network}`, in the above filename, can be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.  Pick one of the above architectures, download the corresponding bottleneck features, and store the downloaded file in the `bottleneck_features/` folder in the repository.
# 
# ###  Obtain Bottleneck Features
# 
# In the code block below, extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the train, test, and validation sets by running the following:
# 
#     bottleneck_features = np.load('bottleneck_features/Dog{network}Data.npz')
#     train_{network} = bottleneck_features['train']
#     valid_{network} = bottleneck_features['valid']
#     test_{network} = bottleneck_features['test']

# In[77]:


### TODO: Obtain bottleneck features from another pre-trained CNN.( VGG19 Network)

bottleneck_features1 = np.load('/data/bottleneck_features/DogVGG19Data.npz')

# ### Model Architecture
# 
# Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  At the end of your code cell block, summarize the layers of your model by executing the line:
#     
#         <your model's name>.summary()
#    
# __Question 5:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# 
# 
# 
# 1) While using CNN for dog breed classification,I have Initiated VGG19 model with the same architecture of VGG16 for transfer learning and got Test accuracy improved from 47.4880% to 49.4019%. I will check bottle neck feature of the other networks because the baseline model Test accuracy is far-off.
# 
# 2) To enhance the Test accuracy and reduce execution time, Created a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning). As the given dataset is small with 6680 entries and new data is similar to original training data, we use the following following method as guidline for Architecture;
# 
#     a) slice off the end of the neural network
#     
#     b) add a new fully connected layer that matches the number of classes in the new data set.
#     
#     c) randomize the weights of the new fully connected layer; freeze all the weights from the pre-trained network.
#     
#     d) train the network to update the weights of the new fully connected layer. 
#     
# 3) With Resnet50 network the model Test accuracy has improved to 79.4258% from 42.8230%. This is a significant improvement. In Next step, will change few of the tuning parameters to check if the accuracy further improves.
# 
# 4) Added a Dropout layer with 0.4 Dropout rate before output layer, improved Test accuracy to 81.93%. Next I will change the Epoch and check for the result.
# 
# 5) With 0.4 Dropout rate , epochs=20 and Batch size=on Resnet50 netwrork model, The Test accuracy improved to 82.4163%%.

# ### Predict Dog Breed with the Model
# 
# Write a function that takes an image path as input and returns the dog breed (`Affenpinscher`, `Afghan_hound`, etc) that is predicted by your model.  
# 
# Similar to the analogous function in Step 5, your function should have three steps:
# 1. Extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the chosen CNN model.
# 2. Supply the bottleneck features as input to the model to return the predicted vector.  Note that the argmax of this prediction vector gives the index of the predicted dog breed.
# 3. Use the `dog_names` array defined in Step 0 of this notebook to return the corresponding breed.
# 
# The functions to extract the bottleneck features can be found in `extract_bottleneck_features.py`, and they have been imported in an earlier code cell.  To obtain the bottleneck features corresponding to your chosen CNN architecture, you need to use the function
# 
#     extract_{network}
#     
# where `{network}`, in the above filename, should be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.

# ## Step 6: Write your Algorithm
# 
# Write an algorithm that accepts a file path to an image and first determines whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither.  Then,

# - if a __human__ is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.

# <a id='step7'></a>
# ## Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
# 
# In this section, you will take your new algorithm for a spin!  What kind of dog does the algorithm think that __you__ look like?  If you have a dog, does it predict your dog's breed accurately?  If you have a cat, does it mistakenly think that your cat is a dog?
# 
# ### Test Your Algorithm on Sample Images!
# 
# Test your algorithm at least six images on your computer.  Feel free to use any images you like.  Use at least two human and two dog images.  
# 
# __Question 6:__ Is the output better than you expected :) ?  Or worse :( ?  Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# 
# Yes, output is better than I expected with 90% correct classifications. There are few improvements which I feel should help for improving the Test Accuracy.
# 
# 1) Adding more images of dogs to increase the training dataset as current data set is relatively small to predict 133 variety of Dog Breed .
# 
# 2) Further fine tune model parameters e.g. epochs, dropout rate & Batch size.
# 
# 3) Train the model using other Transfer learning model using Inception, Exception networks.
# 
# 4) Increase the depth of the network for identifying additional features by adding more set of Convolutional layer and pooling layer .
# 
# 5) Validation loss is not increasing consitently with increasing the epochs. Need to experiment with reduced epochs for the Test accuracy improvement.
